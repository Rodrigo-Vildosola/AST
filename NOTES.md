### 1. **Add a Simplification Method**

Each node should have a method (e.g., `simplify()`) that returns a new, simplified version of the expression. This method can recursively traverse the AST and apply transformation rules. For example:

- **Constant Folding:**  
  An addition node that has two number nodes as children can combine them into a single number node.
  
- **Elimination of Identity Elements:**  
  Removing additions with zero, multiplications with one, etc.

**Example:**

```cpp
virtual Node* simplify() const = 0;
```

Implementations in nodes like `AdditionNode` might look like:
```cpp
Node* AdditionNode::simplify() const {
    Node* leftSimplified = left->simplify();
    Node* rightSimplified = right->simplify();
    // If both are numbers, perform constant folding.
    if(auto leftNum = dynamic_cast<NumberNode*>(leftSimplified))
      if(auto rightNum = dynamic_cast<NumberNode*>(rightSimplified))
         return new NumberNode(leftNum->getValue() + rightNum->getValue());
    // Otherwise, return a new AdditionNode with simplified children.
    return new AdditionNode(leftSimplified, rightSimplified);
}
```

---

### 2. **Introduce a Derivative Method**

For symbolic differentiation, add a method like `derivative(const std::string& variable)`. This method should be virtual on the base class and implemented by each node type according to differentiation rules.

**Example:**

```cpp
virtual Node* derivative(const std::string& variable) const = 0;
```

In a `VariableNode`, the derivative with respect to itself is 1, and 0 otherwise. For an addition node, the derivative is the addition of the derivatives of its children.

---

### 3. **Substitution Capability**

A substitution method (e.g., `substitute(const std::string& var, Node* value)`) lets you replace variables with other expressions. This is useful when solving equations symbolically or applying specific transformation rules.

**Example:**

```cpp
virtual Node* substitute(const std::string& variable, Node* value) const = 0;
```

Each node would recursively substitute within its children. For a `VariableNode`, if the name matches the variable, return a copy of the provided value.

---

### 4. **Implement a Cloning Interface**

For transformations that return new ASTs without modifying the original, provide a `clone()` method. This method should create a deep copy of the node. This can be very useful when applying multiple transformations or when backing up the original expression.

**Example:**

```cpp
virtual Node* clone() const = 0;
```

---

### 5. **Transformation Trace Enhancements**

While your current trace logs evaluation steps, you may also want to log symbolic transformation steps. Consider expanding your trace system to record transformation steps along with the “before” and “after” states. This might involve a structured record:

```cpp
struct TransformationStep {
    std::string description;
    std::string before;
    std::string after;
};

class Trace {
public:
    static void addTransformation(const std::string& description, const std::string& before, const std::string& after);
    // ... existing methods ...
};
```

Each transformation method (like `simplify()`) can call `Trace::addTransformation(...)` to log the change.

---

### 6. **Equation Solving Interface**

For your goal of solving single‑variable equations symbolically, you could extend your `EqualityNode` or build a dedicated solver class. For example, an `EqualityNode` could offer a method like:

```cpp
// Solve the equation for the given variable, if possible.
virtual Node* solveFor(const std::string& variable) const;
```

This method would use a combination of simplification, substitution, and inversion of operations to isolate the variable.

---

### Summary of Node Enhancements

- **Base Node:**  
  In addition to `evaluate(const Env &env)` and `toString()`, add:
  - `Node* simplify() const`
  - `Node* derivative(const std::string& variable) const`
  - `Node* substitute(const std::string& variable, Node* value) const`
  - `Node* clone() const`

- **Operator Nodes (Addition, Multiplication, etc.):**  
  Implement the above methods using standard algebraic rules.

- **VariableNode and NumberNode:**  
  For `VariableNode`, define differentiation and substitution rules; for `NumberNode`, these operations are trivial.

- **EqualityNode / Equation Solving:**  
  Provide a method to symbolically solve for a variable.

- **Trace:**  
  Expand your trace mechanism to log symbolic transformations alongside numeric evaluations.
